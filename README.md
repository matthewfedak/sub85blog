## About

This is basically your average Jekyll install with some html, markdown and Sass hackery.

I added some grunt tasks to save the git commit revision number so I can link to each revision on Github from the site footer and to minify the generated CSS.

I deploy it to AWS S3 and handle AWS Cloudfront using the awesome [s3_website](https://github.com/laurilehmijoki/s3_website) gem.
